Person-service, Connection-service is implemented with REST communication because:
 - It does not handle a large volume of concurrent requests
 - Its simple to implement REST
 - The data is more complex (Person information)

Location service includes two microservices: location-server and location-add.
Location-server is a grpc-server and Location-add is a queue consumer.
Location-server is implemented with GRPC communication because:
 - The coordinates will be updated in realtime (faster API)
 - Handle multiple requests simultaneously
 - Simple data and data is hardly changed frequently

Location-add is implement with Queue communication.
The coordinates data will be sent in a huge volume while DB cannot handle a large amount of  requests.
